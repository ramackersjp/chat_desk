## ⚡ Contributing

Hey this is for you, if you want to help in building the project,

Since, the core of the program is separated and independent of the UI,
There seems a hassle of building both the core and the UI for testing changes/features,

**⚡ But this is not the case with chat_desk ⚡**

For debugging purpose, you can replace the spawner command in `server_handler.dart`,
to enable embedded core,

All you need to do is to replace,

Only this line
```dart
    _serverProcess = await Process.start(
"${!Platform.isWindows ? "./" : ""}chat_desk_core.exe", []);
```

With this line
```dart
    _serverProcess = await Process.start(
"dart", ["lib/core/server/server.dart"]);
```

_And thats all, your embedded server is ready for testing!!_
